        <p class="content">The city of Prague (Praha) is the dream destination of every traveller and is one of the most popular holiday destinations around the world. The city offers something for everyone and each one of us will surely find something to love there.

            Prague boasts of being the capital of the Czech Republic, but actually, it is the social and cultural capital of the entire region of central Europe. It has been enriched by cultures and traditions of many eras like Gothic, Baroque and Renaissance, and each one of them has made an impression on the city which you will feel while touring around. Geographically, Prague lies on the banks of the Vltava River and has oceanic and humid continental climate which is greatly enjoyed by the visitors.</p>
        <h2 class="content">History</h2>
        <p class="content">Prague became the capital of independent Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918. Prague Castle became the place for the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. In between World War I and World War II, Prague became closer to Paris. During World War II (1939 - 1945), Prague was occupied by Nazi - Germany. After the war, Czechoslovakia was re-established as an independent state, and Sudeten Germans were thrown out and sent back to Germany and Austria.

                In 1946 the communists (KSC) became the dominant party and formed a coalition government with other socialist parties. In 1948 the communists seized power and many democrats fled the country. In the 1950’s the country suffered harsh repression and decline, Stalin style practices adopted by the KSC (Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) proved to be more damaging than anything. Eventually, those in charge of the KSC were executed.<br/>On 17th November 1989, the Velvet Revolution started in Prague that ended communism thus making Czechoslovakia a democratic country. In January 1990, the first democratic elections were conducted, making Václav Havel the president. On 1st January 1993, Czechoslovakia was split into two independent countries, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Prague became the capital of Czech Republic.

                The Czechs’ relations with Germany and Austria in the year 2000 were tense due to the Czechs’ refusal to remove the Temelin nuclear power station in southern Bohemia. Also, the removal of German Sudetens after World War II, stripping them of their Czechoslovakian citizenship, still remains an issue. Despite political apologies, German Sudetens are still prevented by law from re-claiming their property.
                
                Václav Havel was elected as the first president of Czech Republic in January 1993. Then again in January 1998-2003 Vaclav Havel was re-elected as president by a margin of one vote.
                
                Vaclav Klaus (right wing) became the second president in 2003 and again reelected in 2008.
                
                In 1999, the Czech Republic joined NATO and was approved as a member of the European Union in 2002. On 1st May 2004, the Czech Republic was then accepted by the European Union.
                
                In the year 2002 many buildings and underground transport system got damaged due to extensive floods in Prague.
                
                The Prague bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics was an unsuccessful bid. In 2009, due to the global recession, Prague withdrew its name from the bidding for the 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>
                <h2 class="content">Tourist Attractions</h2>
                <p class="content">The Major Tourist attractions are as follows:
                <ul class="content">
                   <li>Located in the Mala Strana in the heart of the city, the Infant Jesus of Prague (also known as the Child of Prague) is a Roman Catholic statue of Jesus Christ as an infant. Everyday hundreds of believers pay a visit to this shrine to pray, bow and make wishes hoping that they will come true. The statue itself is encased in an ornate gilded shrine and while the origin of the figure is unknown, it has been dated back to the 16th Century.</li>
                   <li>Despite Prague’s lively history of invasions, the Old Town Square has remained relatively untouched since the 10th Century. Swarms of tourists crowd the historical streets, packing out the alfresco restaurants everyday. The square itself is the perfect place to admire the wonderful architecture Prague has to offer and if that isn’t your thing then the various street performers, musicians and merchants that line the streets here will certainly keep you entertained.</li>
                   <li>Whoever said that “the best things in life are free” may well have been referring to the Charles Bridge in Prague. A simple walk across the 14th Century bridge is one of the most enjoyable and memorable experiences of visiting Prague. The bridge was commissioned in 1357 by Charles IV to replace an older bridge that had been washed away by floods. Although completed in 1390, with the striking statues added in the 17th century, the bridge did not take Charles’ name until the 19th century.</li>
                   <li>The Jewish quarter, also known as Josefov, is located between the Old Town and the Vltava River. Its history began in the 13th century when Jews living in Prague were ordered to vacate their homes and settle in this one area. The Jews were banned from living anywhere else in the city and were joined by fellow exiled Jews from other European countries. To add to their hardship, many buildings in the area were destroyed in the late 19th century when the cities layout was remodeled. Fortunately, many significant historical buildings remain including six synagogues and are well worth a visit.</li>
                   <li>Located in Hradcany (the Castle district), Prague Castle is without a doubt the city’s most popular tourist attraction and it is easy to see why. The breath-taking castle has traditionally been the seat of Czech rulers and is today the official residence of the president. Entry to the grounds of the castle are free although many buildings such as the St Vitus cathedral, Basillica of St George and Golden Lane can be visited with a combined entry ticket.</li>
                   <li>Walk through the sublime urban area of Stare Mesto within the Old Town of Prague and look to the sky. You will be surprised to find a seven foot tall sculpture of the world famous psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud hanging from a metal beam above the cobbled streets at your feet. The unusual artwork has proven so popular that it has been exhibited in cities all over the world including Chicago, London and Berlin. Often mistaken for a suicide attempt, the sculpture has also been responsible for several calls to the emergency services since its creation.</li>
                   <li>Seeing Prague from the river Vltava is a unique experience and offers a way to see the many historical buildings and monuments from a different perspective. Cruises within the city are competitively priced and often include lunch or dinner depending on the time of day you choose to embark. Choosing a cruise with a duration of two hours or more, will ensure that you are aboard long enough to escape the hustle and bustle of Prague city center and allow you to enjoy the serenity of some of the quieter riverbanks on the Vltava river.</li>
